## DATA Structures and Algorithms

This repository documents your journey through learning data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring these fundamental concepts and practicing their C skills.

**Description:**

*Learn the intricacies of data structures and algorithms, all implemented in C!* (Use italics for emphasis)

**Content:**

<hr>  * ### Data Structures
    * Explore various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs.
    * Gain a solid understanding of their functionalities through clear explanations and code examples.
* ### Algorithms
    * Delve into sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.
    * Master their implementation details and time/space complexity analysis.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Consider adding badges (e.g., for difficulty level, language) using Markdown extensions for a more visual appeal.
* Include links to helpful resources for further exploration.

**Remember:**

This is just a starting point. Feel free to experiment with different formatting options and personalize your README to reflect your learning journey!
